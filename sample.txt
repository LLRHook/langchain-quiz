The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed primarily to conduct infrared astronomy. As the largest optical telescope in space, its high infrared resolution and sensitivity allow it to view objects too old and distant for the Hubble Space Telescope. This is expected to enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.

JWST was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first JWST image was released to the public via a White House briefing on 11 July 2022. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.

The telescope has a 6.5-meter primary mirror made of 18 hexagonal gold-plated beryllium segments. A five-layer sunshield the size of a tennis court protects the telescope from the Sun's heat. JWST operates in a halo orbit around the L2 point, approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. Unlike Hubble, which orbits Earth at about 547 kilometers, JWST is too far away to be serviced by crewed missions.

JWST's instruments include the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS/NIRISS). These instruments allow scientists to observe in wavelengths ranging from 0.6 to 28.3 micrometers, covering near-infrared and mid-infrared spectra.

The total cost of the JWST project is estimated at approximately $10 billion, making it one of the most expensive scientific instruments ever built. The project involved collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Despite initial plans to launch in 2007, numerous delays pushed the launch date back by over 14 years.
